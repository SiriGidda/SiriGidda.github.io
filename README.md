# SIRI GIDDA
still need to add many things into my website

here is my [linkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siri-gidda-/)


So the first question that everyone asks me after listening my name is - **Is that your full name or any extentions?**
My routine answer for that question is - **Just _SIRI_ simple and sweet :)**

So now talking about me.....
![about me](abtme.jpg)
I am neither an introvert nor an extrovert. I'm an **_ambivert_**


Now the next question - is it ok to be an ambivert?
>You can be an introvert or extrovert or ambivert or anyother vert what I suggest is just be you yarrr
